\subsection{Testing the strategy}
To the test the strategy we will consider a scenario with three applications trying to send data to a sink by using three interfaces.
The simulation will be ran on a fixed 1200 seconds timeframe. \\



\subsection{The interfaces}

We will be using the following interfaces to test our strategy:

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{%
		\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
			\hline
			\# & bandwidth (packets per second) & error rate (as a percentage) & delay (ms) & cost \\ \hline
			1  & 10                             & 20\%                         & 150        & 10   \\ \hline
			2  & 20                             & 10\%                         & 100        & 20   \\ \hline
			3  & 30                             & 1\%                          & 30         & 100  \\ \hline
		\end{tabular}%
	}
\end{table}

\subsection{The applications}
We will be using three applications that generate traffic in a sinusoidal pattern. \\ 
At each second we will be sampling the traffic generated by each application; we will run multiple test cases and the applications may or may not have some noise or some horizontal shift applied to them.
